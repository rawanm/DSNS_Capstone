# Starbucks Capstone Challenge - What's in an offer?

> This project (Data Scientist Capstone) is part of Udacity's Data Scientists Nanodegree Program. Detailed analysis with all required code is posted in my Github repository and Jupyter Notebook.

One thing Starbuck does well is to keep customers satisfied, with increasing compition let us see if it it only a social phenomenon, or that Starbuck cares about gaining and maintaining customers loyalty!

## Libraries:
Listed below all packages and libraries used in this project: 
* [Python](https://www.python.org) Version (3.6.8)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) (Data Processing, and manipulatoin)
* [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org) (Data Processing, and manipulatoin)
* [Sklearn](https://sklearn.org) (Machine Learning model)
* [Plotly](https://plot.ly) (Interactive Plots)


## Project Motivation:
The goal of this project is to analyze customers behavior and interactions with special offers sent on the app. Firstly, we want to explore customers demographics, and customers transcript data. Further on, we will focus on customers interaction with offers. Finally, we will study these interactions by building a machine learning model that will cluster customers based on similar behaviors. We will formulate the problem into the following set of questions that we will aim to answer as we go through the analysis:
1. Who are our customers, and their demographics?
2. What are the characteristics of custumers transcripts?
3. What are the characteristics of customers interactions with the offers?
4. What are the main customers segments based on their behavioral patterns?


## File description:
1. Jupyter notebook with complete analysis code
2. HTML copy of Jupyter notebook
3. Data files, The data from Starbucks rewards app, is contained in three files: 
    * portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
    * profile.json - demographic data for each customer
    * transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

## Results: 
A summary of the results of the analysis is described in detailed as [Jupyter notebook](), and in this published [Medium blog post]().
